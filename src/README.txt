src/ folder structure:
- pages/: All main page components (Home, Login, Register, Dashboards, etc.)
- components/: Reusable UI components (ProductList, OrderList, Header, Footer, etc.)
- context/: React context (AuthContext, etc.)
- services/: API and data logic (if needed)
- assets/: Images and static files
- styles: Global and shared CSS

Remove duplicate/unused files from src/ and keep only one version in the correct folder.
